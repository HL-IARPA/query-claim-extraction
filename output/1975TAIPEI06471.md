BEGIN CONFIDENTIAL:
1.  SUMMARY:  CONTINUING THE CURRENT EMPHASIS ON MILITARY SELF-
RELIANCE, MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE (MND) KAO KUEI-YUAN
(7559/7608/0337), IN REPLY TO QUESTIONS IN THE LEGISLATIVE
YUAN, DISCUSSED ON SEPTEMBER 30 THE GROC'S ABILITY TO PRO-
DUCE ITS OWN WEAPONS (SEE REF A).  IN ADDITION TO NOTING MND'S
CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS HE ALSO REITERATED
PREMIER CHIANG'S EARLIER STATEMENTS THAT THE GROC CAN MANU-
FACTURE NUCLEAR WEAPONS, BUT WILL NOT DO SO.  HE ALSO DIS-
CUSSED MND EFFORTS TO EXPAND DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF WEAPONS
THROUGH COOPERATION WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY.
2.  WHILE MINISTER KAO'S COMMENTS WERE DELIVERED IN THE CON-
TEXT OF SELF-RELIANCE, THEY -- ALONG WITH OTHER RECENT LIMITED
REMARKS ON MILITARY PRODUCTION -- SUGGEST THAT THE GOVERNMENT
IS LOOKING AHEAD TO POSSIBLE RESTRICTIONS ON U.S. MILITARY
SALES TO THE ROC AS A RESULT OF THE DEVELOPING US/PRC RELATION
SHIP.  END SUMMARY.
END CONFIDENTIAL.
BEGIN LIMITED OFFICIAL USE:
3.  DURING THE INTERPELLATION PERIOD IN THE LEGISLATIVE YUAN
ON SEPTEMBER 30, MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE KAO DISCUSSED
THE GROC'S ABILITY TO PRODUCE ITS OWN WEAPONS.  PICKING UP A
POINT REPORTED IN THE PRESS RECENTLY, HE SAID THE GROC IS PRO-
DUCING SIDEWINDER MISSILES (SEE REF B) AS WELL AS ITS OWN AIR-
CRAFT (F-5 CO-PRODUCTION), AND COMBAT VESSELS (PRESUMABLY THE
TACOMA BOAT PSMM PROJECT) "IN COOPERATION WITH A FRIENDLY
COUNTRY."  HE ALSO SAID TAIWAN HAS PLANS TO PRODUCE OTHER TYPES
OF MISSILES AND TANKS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
4.  AFTER LISTING A WIDE RANGE OF CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS
CURRENTLY PRODUCED BY THE COMBINED SERVICE FORCE -- RIFLES,
MORTARS, ETC. -- MINISTER KAO SAID THE MND AGENCY IN CHARGE
OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (PRESUMABLY THE CHUNG SHAN SCIENCE
INSTITUTE) HAS THE TECHNICIANS AND FACILITIES TO MANUFACTURE
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  HOWEVER, HE REITERATED PREMIER CHIANG
CHING-KOU'S EARLIER REMARKS THAT THE ROC WOULD NOT DO SO.
5.  KAO ALSO SAID THE ROC WAS DEVELOPING WEAPONS AND EQUIP-
MENT IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INDUS-
TRIES, ADDING THAT MND AND THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
HAVE FORMULATED A "PROJECT FOR COOPERATION AMONG MILITARY,
STATE-OWNED, AND PRIVATE INDUSTRIES."  HE ALSO SAID THAT UN-
SCHEDULED EXHIBITS OF MILITARY SUPPLIES HAD BEEN HELD; INDUS-
TRIAL LEADERS HAD BEEN INVITED TO VISIT AND OBSERVE -- AND WE
ASSUME TO EXPRESS AN INTEREST IN PRODUCING THESE SUPPLIES.
END LIMITED OFFICIAL USE.
BEGIN CONFIDENTIAL:
6.  COMMENT:  MINISTER KAO'S COMMENTS AS WELL AS OTHER RECENT
REMARKS ON MILITARY PRODUCTION APPEAR TO BE PART OF THE GROC'S
INCREASING PUBLIC EMPHASIS ON SELF-RELIANCE.  THIS THEME NO
DOUBT ALSO REFLECTS A ROC JUDGMENT THAT FOR VARIOUS
REASONS -- US/PRC DETENTE, CONGRESSIONAL LIMITATIONS ON ARMS
SALES, U.S. REFUSAL TO SELL CERTAIN TYPES OF SOPHISTICATED
WEAPONRY -- THE U.S. CAN NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON AS THE SOLE
SOURCE OF MILITARY HARDWARE.  THUS WE MAY EXPECT THE ROC TO
CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO EXPAND DOMESTIC PRODUCTION AND TO
DEVELOP THIRD COUNTRY SOURCES.
END CONFIDENTIAL.
BEGIN SECRET:
7.  CURRENT PUBLICITY ABOUT DOMESTIC PRODUCTION AS WELL AS THE
"UNSCHEDULED" EXHIBITS OF MILITARY SUPPLIES ALSO SUGGESTS
THAT THE ROC IS CONTEMPLATING PURSUING MORE ACTIVELY THIRD
PARTY CUSTOMERS FOR ITS DOMESTIC PRODUCTION.  AS DEPARTMENT
IS AWARE, IN THE PAST TAIWAN HAS OCCASIONALLY FOUND THIRD
COUNTRY MARKETS FOR CERTAIN ITEMS.  IF DOMESTIC PRODUCTION
IS EXPANDED, THE GROC MAY SEEK EXTERNAL MARKETS BOTH TO REDUCE
COSTS FOR ITS OWN ARMED SERVICES AS WELL AS TO FULL UTILIZE
INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY.
END SECRET.
