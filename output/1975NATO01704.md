B. THE HAGUE 1510
SUMMARY WE AGREE WITH EMBASSY LONDON THAT BRITISH WITHDRAWAL FROM THE
EC COULD BE DAMAGING TO NATO, AND THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF
WITHDRAWAL MAY FURTHER WEAKIEN BRITISH CONTRIBUTION TO ALLIANCE
DEFENCE. IN ADDITION, THE RESENTMENTS GENERATED BY BRITAIN'S
DEPARTURE FROM THE EC WULD HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE EFFECT ON ITER-
ALLIANCE RELATIONS. THE BRITISH WOULD PROBABLY
ATTACH INCREASED IMPORTANCE TO NATO AS AN INSTRITUTION FOLLOWING
WITHDRAWAL FROM EC, AND MIGHT SEEK A "JUNIOR PARTNER" RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE U.S. WITHIN THE ALLIANCE. UK WITHDRAWAL MIGHT FURTHER
WEAKEN EUROPEAN CONFIDENCE AT A TIME OF ECONOMIC DESLOCATION,
CHALLENGE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN FLANK, AND GROWING MILITARY STRENGTH.
END SUMMARY.
1. MISSION READD WITH INTEREST LONDON'S LUCID ANALYSIS OF POSSIBLE
CONSEQUENCES IF THE UK DECIDES TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EC. WE AGREE
THAT BRITISH WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EC CULD BE DAMAGING TO NATO,
WITH THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITIONS THAT
ACCOMPANIED WITHDRAWAL. THE NATURE OF THE NEW RELATIONSHIP
WORKED OUT BETWEEN THE UK AND THE REMAINING EIGHT WOULD BE
IMPORTANT IN THIS REGARD. WHETHER BRITAIN THEN CHOSE TO INSULAR,
OR AN OUTWARD-LOOKING POLICY WOULD BE TOO. AND, PERSHPS MOST
SIGNIFICANT, BRITAIN'S CONTRIBUTION TO AND INFLUENCE IN THE
ALLIANCE WOULD BE DEEPLY AFFECTED BY HER FUTURE ECONOMIC HEALTH.
LONG-RUN SEVERE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWAL ON THE UK MIGHT
RESULT IN DEFENSE CUTS EVEN DEEPER THAN THOSE PLANNED AS A
RESULT OF THE DEFENSE REVIEW, THUS FURTHER WEAKENING BRITISH
CONTRIBUTIONS TO ALLIANCE DEFENSE.
2. IN ADDITION, THE RESENTMENTS GENERATED BY BRITAIN'S DEPARTURE
WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE THEIR EFFECT ON INTER-ALLIANCE RELATIONS.
THE PROCESS OF UK DISENGAGEMENT FROM THE EC WOULD, WHILE IT
LASTED, DISTRACT THE EUROPEAN ALLIED MEMBERS OF THE EC FROM THE
NEED FOR MORE CONSTRUCTIVE ENDEAVORS IN NATO. UK WITHDRAWAL
FROM THE EC WOULD, HOWWEVER, PROBABLY INCREASE THE IMPORTANCETHE
UK ATTACHES TO NATO AS AN INSTITUTION. UK DCM LOGAN (WHO THINKS
UK WITHDRAWAL WOULD BE A DISASTER) MADE THIS POINT RECENTLY TO A
MISSON OFFICER. LOGAN OBSERVED THAT NATO AND OECD WOULD THEN BE
THE PRINCIPAL ORGANIZATION LINKING THE UK WITH THEUROPEANS, AND
THE UK WOULD PROBABLY WISH TO USE NATO FOR A BROADER RANGE OF CON-
SULTATIONS THAN IT DOES NOW.
3. EVEN UNDER OPTIMISTIC ASSUMPTIONS, THE UK'S POLITICAL INFLU-
ENCE INNATO WOULD, HOWEVER DIMINSH FOLLOWING WITHDRAWAL FROM
THE EC. THE UK, WHICH UNDER HEATH TENDED TO PLAY SECOND FIDDLE
TO THE FRENCH IN NATO AFFAIRS, HAS TRIED DURING WILSON'S TENURE
TO PLAY AN HONEST BROKER ROLE BETWEEN THE OTHER EC EIGHT AND THE
U.S. SUCH A NATO ROLE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BECOME IMPOSSIBLE INTHE
EVENT OF WITHDRAWAL, AND THE UK MIGHT THEN ATTEMPT TO GRAVITATE
TOWARD THE U.S. AND PERHAPS  SEEK TO CREATE A "JUNIOR PARTNER"
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S.IN NATO. THE LATTER SORT OF UK ROLE
WOULD BE DISTINCTLY LESS USEFUL TO THE U.S. THAN THE UK ROLE
WITHIN THE EC AS HONEST BROKER.
4. IN CUTTING ITSELF OFF FROM ITS EC PARTNERS, THE UK WOULD PRO-
BABLY ALSO EXERCISE LESS INFLUENCE THAN AT PRESENT IN NATO DEFENSE
DELIBERATIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE HERE WOLD BE BRITAIN'S
TROOP PRESNCE ON THE CONTINENT. IF THISPRESENCEIS MAINTAINED,
AT PRESENT STRENGTH, THE UK'S VOICE IN ALLIANCE DEFENSE POLICY
WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT ONE; REDUCTION OR DEPARTURE OF
THE TROOPS WOULD DRASTICALLY DIMINISH UK INFLUENCE.
5. WE AGREE WITH LONDON THAT WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EC WOULD TEND
TO SLOW DOWN THE EUROGROUP'S MODEST PROGRESS TOWARDS MORE CONCRETE
EUOPEAN DEFENSE COOPERATION WITHIN THE ALLIANCE. EFFORTS TO
STANDARDIZE THE COPRODUCEDMILITARY EQUIPMENT WOULD PROBABLY ALSO
BE SET BACK.
6. FINALLY, MISSON BELIEVES UK WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EC MIGHT HAVE
AN ADDITIONAL IMPACT ON THE ALLIANCE THROUGH THE EFFECT IT WOULD
HAVE ONEUROPEAN CONFIDENCE, COMING AS IT WOULD AT A TIME OF
ECONOMIC DISLOCATION THROUGHOUT EUROPE, OF CHALLENGE ACROSS
EUROPE'S ENTIRE SOUTHERN FLANK, AND OF GROWING SOVIET
MILITARY STRENGTH.
