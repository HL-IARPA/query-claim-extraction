SUMMARY: ITALIAN AMBASSADOR WHO RECENTLY RETURNED FROM
ROME, SAID LONG-PLANNED ITALIAN PROPOSAL FOR HIGH-LEVEL
POLITICAL MISSION TO ETHIOPIA IN INTERESTS OF IMPROVING
BILATERAL RELATIONS IS MOVING AHEAD. BEFORE LEAVING FOR
ROME, HOWEVER, AN EPMG CONTACT ASKED HIM TO REQUEST GOI TO
PASS MESSAGE TO ERITREAN INSURGENTS RESIDENT IN ITALY, TO
EFFECT THAT EPMG WISHED SIT DOWN WITH THEM AND DISCUSS
PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF ERITREAN PROBLEM. GOI DOES NOT
WANT TO PLAY ROLE OF MEDIATOR AND AUTHORIZED AMBASSADOR ON
HIS RETURN TO SAY ONLY THAT GOI WOULD AGREE TO ITALIAN
MISSIONS ABROAD PASSING MESSAGE TO LOCAL ERITREAN INSURGENT
CONTACTS. ETHIOPIANS SEEM TO HAVE LOST INTEREST, HOW-
EVER. AMBASSADOR CANNOT FIND ANYONE WHO WANTS TO HEAR
GOI REPLY (INCLUDING HIS "CONTACT") DESPITE HIS HAVING
RETURNED OVER WEEK AGO. HE THEREFORE NO LONGER KNOWS
WHAT TO MAKE OF SITUATION, INCLUDING FUTURE OF MISSION.
PROBLEM IS COMPLICATED BY EPMG REFUSAL PERMIT ENTRY OF
ITALIAN DIPLOMATIC POUCHES UNINSPECTED. INFO TOLD TO
ME IN STRICT CONFIDENCE AND ADDRESSEES SHOULD HOLD IT
STRICTLY NOFORN. END SUMMARY.
1. I CALLED ON ITALIAN AMBASSADOR GUIDI NOV 15 TO IN-
QUIRE ABOUT RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS HE HAD HAD IN ROME
APPROXIMATELY WEEK AGO AND FOUND HIM TO BE A PERPLEXED
MAN. ROME HAD CALLED HIM HOME TO DISCUSS A PROPOSED
HIGH-LEVEL POLITICAL VISIT TO ETHIOPIA THAT HAS BEEN
UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR WELL OVER A YEAR. OBJECT OF
VISIT WOULD BE TO STRENGTHEN ITALO-ETHIOPIAN TIES, AND
DELEGATION WOULD BE PREPARED DISCUSS AREAS OF ASSISTANCE
OF INTEREST TO ETHIOPIA AND PROBABLY MAKE SUGGESTIONS
ABOUT HOW ITALY MIGHT BE HELPFUL. PROPOSED VISIT HAS
BEEN PUSHED BY GUIDI NOT ONLY IN AN EFFORT IMPROVE BI-
LATERIAL RELATIONS, BUT ALSO AS MEASURE OF SUPPORT FOR
POSITION OF ITALIAN COMMUNITY IN ETHIOPIA (APPROX 3000
IN ADDIS AREA, 1000 IN ASMARA), AND HAS BEEN UNDER DIS-
CUSSION WITH ETHIOPIANS WHO HAVE BLOWN HOT AND COLD.
RECENTLY, HOWEVER, ETHIOPIANS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THEY
WOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE DELEGATION VISIT, AND ITALIANS
HAVE BEEN PROCEEDING ACCORDINGLY.
2. EVENING BEFORE LEAVING FOR ROME, GUIDI RECEIVED
REQUEST TO MEET WITH A "CONTACT) (HE DID NOT IDENTIFY).
"CONTACT" PURPORTEDLY SPOKE FOR EPMG AND ASKED GUIDI
TO ASK HIS GOVERNMENT TO PASS WORD THROUGH GOI CONTACTS
WITH ERITREAN INSURGENT REPS IN ITALY THAT EPMG WANTED
TO DISCUSS ERITREAN SITUATION WITH INSURGENT REPS,
PRESUMABLY WITH VIEW TO REACHING PEACEFUL SOLUTION.
REQUEST CAUGHT GUIDI BY SURPRISE AND HE PROMISED ONLY
TO RELAY IT TO HIS GOVERNMENT. GUIDI TOLD ME REACTION
OF HIS GOVERNMENT WAS ESSENTIALLY NEGATIVE -- ITALY
WANTS NO PART OF ROLE OF MEDIATOR AND DOES NOT WANT TO
DEAL WITH ERITREANS IN ITALY (WHO, ACCORDING GUIDI, NO
LONGER HAVE MUCH INTEREST IN ERITREAN PROBLEM ANYWAY,
BUT ARE PRINCIPALLY INTERESTED IN TOPPLING PRESENT EPMG
(COMMENT - READ SYMPATHIZERS OF ETHIOPIAN PEOPLE'S
REVOLUTIONARY PARTY). INSURGENTS' ITALIAN CONTACTS ARE
MAINLY AMONG MEMBERS OF COMMUNIST PARTY AND "EXTRA-
PARLIAMENTARY GROUPS.") GOI ALSO SAW REQUEST AS
PRESSURE TACTIC TO INSURE ETHIOPIAN ACCEPTANCE OF
POLITICAL MISSION.
3. ACCORDINGLY, GUIDI WAS AUTHORIZED TO REPLY ONLY
THAT GOI WOULD AGREE TO PASS MESSAGE TO INSURGENT
GROUPS THROUGH ITALIAN MISSIONS ABROAD. WHEN GUIDI
RETURNED TO ETHIOPIA, HOWEVER, EXPECTING HIS "CONTACT"
TO ASK HIM IMMEDIATELY FOR GOI'S REPLY, HE FOUND THAT
NO ONE, INCLUDING HIS "CONTACT" SEEMED AT ALL INTERESTED.
"CONTACT" MERELY TOLD HIM HE WOULD CALL, AND AS OF TIME
OF OUR CONVERSATION, ALTHOUGH GUIDI HAS BEEN BACK WELL
OVER WEEK, HE HAS YET TO CONVEY GOI'S RESPONSE. IN
VIEW OF NATURE OF REPLY, THIS DOESN'T BOTHER HIM; WHAT
DOES CONCERN HIM IS APPARENT SWITCH IN SIGNALS. EITHER
EPMG HAS HAD CHANGE OF HEART DURING HIS ABSENCE ABOUT
PROSPECTIVE ITALIAN VISIT, OR THERE HAS BEEN SOME
DEVELOPMENT RE ERITREAN SITUATION THAT HAS LESSENED EPMG
INTEREST IN GOI GO-BETWEEN ROLE.
4. I MENTIONED RECENT VISIT OF SUDANESE MINISTER
ABDULLAHI EL HASSAN AND FORMATION OF FIVE-MAN ERITREAN
COMMISSION (ADDIS 11201) AS POSSIBLY
