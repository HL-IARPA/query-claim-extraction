```
1. AMID RUMORS SECESSIONISTS ON BOUGAINVILLE ISLAND WERE
BECOMING INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS TO NATIONAL UNITY, GOVERNOR
GENERAL, SIR JOHN GUISE, DISPATCHED TWO MEMBERS OF HIS STAFF
TO TALK WITH DISTRICT OFFICIALS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS ON
BOUGAINVILLE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A CLEAR READING OF THE
DEVELOPING CRISIS. HIS RESEARCH ASSISTANT AND PRIVATE
SECRETARY SPENT TWO DAYS DURING THE WEEK OF OCTOBER 6-10
AND RETURNED WITH INFORMATION THAT SECESSIONISTS:  1) ARE
EXTREMELY WELL ORGANIZED AT ALL LEVELS; 2) HAVE OBTAINED FUNDS
"RUNNING IN SIX FIGURES" FROM PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN AND
PLANTATION OWNERS, MOSTLY EXPATRIATES; 3) HAVE VIRTUALLY
FULL SUPPORT OF THE BOUGAINVILLIAN POPULATION; AND 4)
HAVE THEIR PEOPLE IN KEY POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT,
MANY ON THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT'S PAYROLL.
2. IN A PRIVATE CONVERSATION OCTOBER 10 WITH EMBOFF,
GUISE'S RESEARCH OFFICER WHO MADE THE TRIP SAID
SITUATION HAD DETERIORATED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT
UNLESS GPNG MOVED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS MILITARY FORCE
WOULD BE INEVITABLE. THE RESEARCH OFFICER, CHRIS VON
LIESHOUT, IS AN AUSTRALIAN. HE SAID THAT GUISE HAD
BECOME INCREASINGLY CONCERNED AT GPNG'S INACTIVITY
AND DECIDED TO OBTAIN A FIRST-HAND REPORT ON CONDITIONS
ON BOUGAINVILLE. THE REPORTERS FOUND SECESSIONISTS
ACTIVE ON ALL FRONTS. THEY ARE MAINTAINING DAILY
CONTACT THROUGH TELEX WITH ENGLISHMAN, GRANVILLE JONES,
WHO WAS REPUTED TO BE INVOLVED IN BIAFRAN INSURRECTION.
RICK HEARNE, THE ACTING DISTRICT COMMISSIONER, HAS BEEN
ABLE TO SECRETLY OBTAIN A NUMBER OF MESSAGES COMING
IN FROM GRANVILLE JONES WHICH, ACCORDING TO LIESHOUT,
ARE "BLUEPRINTS" FOR SECESSIONIST ACTIVITY.
3. LIESHOUT ALSO SAID MANY CENTRAL GOVERNMENT PUBLIC
SERVANTS WERE SOLIDLY BEHIND THE SECESSIONIST MOVEMENTS
AND THAT LEO HANNETT WAS WORKING FROM 70 TO 80 HOURS A
WEEK TO GOOD RESULT. HE ALSO REPORTED THE DC HAD
EVIDENCE MANY EXPATRIATE BUSINESSMEN HAD GIVEN
SUBSTANTIAL SUMS OF MONEY "UNDER COERCION OR VOLUNTARILY"
TO THE SECESSIONISTS AND CASH ON HAND NOW EXCEEDS ANY-
THING PREVIOUSLY SUSPECTED BY OFFICIALS IN PORT MORESBY.
4. LIESHOUT ALSO NOTED THAT EVERYWHERE, ON VIRTUALLY
ALL VEHICLES, COULD BE SEEN STICKERS SUPPORTING THE
"REPUBLIC OF THE NORTH SOLOMONS." LOYAL DISTRICT
OFFICIALS ARE BECOMING MORE ISOLATED ALTHOUGH LIESHOUT
BELIEVES THE DC STILL HAS A GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF SECESSIONIST
ACTIVITIES.
5. WHEN THE TWO STAFF MEMBERS REPORTED TO GUISE ON
THEIR RETURN, LIESHOUT COMMENTED GUISE WENT INTO A
"TOWERING RAGE" OVER GPNG INACTION AND SHOUTED THAT
HE WOULD PERSONALLY SEE ACTION WAS TAKEN IMMEDIATELY.
LIESHOUT TOLD EMBOFF HE HAD SUBSEQUENTLY DRAFTED REPORT
WITH FIFTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS, ALL OF WHICH HE BELIEVES
SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED OVER THE NEXT MONTH. ONE
RECOMMENDATION WAS EITHER THE FIRING OR TRANSFER OF
ALL PUBLIC SERVANTS INVOLVED IN SECESSIONIST ACTIVITIES.
LIESHOUT ALSO INTIMATED THAT HE SUGGESTED GPNG CONSIDER
ARRESTING NUMBER OF MOST ACTIVE SECESSIONISTS NOW TO
DEFUSE THE SITUATION.
6. COMMENT:  THE REPORT MAY BE THE CATALYST NEEDED
TO DESTROY THE COMPLACENCY OF SENIOR GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS WHO WERE HOPING THE SECESSIONIST MOVEMENT
COULD BE TREATED LIKE THE PAPUA BESENA MOVEMENT.
BOUGAINVILLE'S SECESSIONISTS HAVE THE MONEY, ORGANIZATION,
AND GRASS ROOTS SUPPORT PAPUA BESENA NEVER HAD, HOWEVER,
PLUS A NUMBER OF DEDICATED MEN WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE
A GOOD CHANCE OF SUCCESS.
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT A VACUUM HAD DEVELOPED IN PORT
MORESBY RE THE BOUGAINVILLE PROBLEM, AND THE FACT THAT
JOHN GUISE HAS MOVED INTO IT COULD HAVE BROADER
REPERCUSSIONS IN NATIONAL POLITICS. END COMMENT.
OLMSTED
