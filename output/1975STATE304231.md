### Cable Body

```
OF SUEZ.
1.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WAS GIVEN USUN BY UN OFFICIALS
(URQUHART AND JONAH) ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT BE PASSED
TO NO OTHER GOVERNMENT, SINCE UN BELIEVES THE BEST CHANCE
OF RESOLVING THE PROBLEM LIES IN KEEPING IT FOR TIME BEING
BETWEEN UNEF COMMAND AND EGYPTIANS.  IF DEPARTMENT WISHES
TO REPEAT THIS TELEGRAM TO CAIRO AND/OR TEL AVIV, WE ASK
THAT THE ABOVE STRICTURE BE PASSED ON.
2.  ACCORDING TO UN, ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO GENERAL MAGHOUB
ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM GAMASY TOLD SIILASVUO THAT EGYPT
WOULD NOT PERMIT UN PATROL BOATS IN GULF OF SUEZ.  THEIR
PRESENCE, HE SAID, WOULD INFRINGE EGYPTIAN SOVEREIGNTY
AND WAS NOT ESSENTIAL TO UN SURVEILLANCE TASKS UNDER THE
SINAI AGREEMENT.  SIILASVUO REPORTED THIS TO UN.  HE WAS
IMMEDIATELY INSTRUCTED TO TELL EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT THAT UN
NAVAL SURVEILLANCE FROM GULF OF SUEZ REPRESENTED A CRITICAL
COMPROMISE AT GENEVA NEGOTIATIONS, ISRAELIS HAVING INITIALLY
INSISTED ON MORE EXTENSIVE GROUND INSPECTIONS BY UN.
SIILASVUO PASSED THIS ON TO MAGHOUB, AT THE SAME TIME MAKING
AN APPOINTMENT TO CALL ON GAMASY DECEMBER 29.  (NOW
RESCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER 30 BECAUSE OF JOINT COMMISSION
MEETING ON 29TH.)  LAST WEEKEND SIILASVUO REPORTED MAGHOUB
INFORMED HIM THAT GAMASY CONTINUED TO OPPOSE STATIONING
OF PATROL BOATS IN GULF -- AND ADDED THAT EGYPT WOULD NOT
PROVIDE UN WITH PORT FACILITIES.  (THIS WAS PROBABLY
ACADEMIC, OUR SOURCES BELIEVE, SINCE IRAN WOULD NOT SEND THE
BOATS OVER EGYPTIAN OBJECTIONS.)
3.  UN CONSIDERS THE DECEMBER 30 MEETING BETWEEN SIILASVUO
AND GAMASY TO BE CRITICAL.  IF EGYPTIANS INSIST ON THEIR
POSITION, SYG BELIEVES HE WILL HAVE TO INFORM ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT.  (HIS AIDES SAY HE IS CONSIDERING OFFICIALLY
NOTIFYING USG AT THAT POINT OR POSSIBLY PRIOR TO IT --
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE INFLUENCED THROUGH URQUHART IF
DEPARTMENT SO INSTRUCTS US.)  SECRETARIAT OFFICIALS REGARD
EGYPT'S POSITION AS A QUANTUM JUMP IN RISK-TAKING IF IT
PERSISTS.  THEY BELIEVE RABIN WOULD PROBABLY CONSIDER RENEGING
ON THE PATROL BOATS SERIOUS ENOUGH TO PUBLICIZE AS A MAJOR
BREACH OF FAITH.
