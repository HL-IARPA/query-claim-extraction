D. STATE 149343
E. STATE 162110
1. MISSION BELIEVES THAT NATO AND USG WORK ON OPTION III CAN NOW
FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON DRAFT GUIDANCE TO THE AHG AND THE SUPPLEMENT,
AND SHOULD PROCEED SIMULTANEOUSLY ON THREE FRONTS:
--GENERAL DISCUSSION IN SPC;
WORK IN THE OPEN-ENDED CAUCUS ON THOSEISSUES BETTER HANDLED
IN MORE TECHNICALLY ORIENTED BODY;
--UNILATERAL PREPARATION OF U.S. POSITION AND POINT PAPERS ON
RELATED ISSUES.
2. PREPARATIION AND CONSIDERATIONOF PUBLIC PRESENTATION AND TIMING
PAPERS SHOULD BE DEFERRED UNTIL AFTER DRAFT GUIDANCE AND SUPPLE-
MENTS ARE NEAR COMPLETION. NAC APPEARED IN AGREEMENT IN ITS
JUNE 27 MEETING THAT PUBLIC PRESENTATION PAPER WOULD BE NEEDED,
BUT THAT ITS PREPARATION SHOULD BE DEFERRED.
3. MISSION BELIEVES USDEL APPROACH REPORTED IN REF B PROVIDES
USEFUL MATERIAL FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUPPLEMENT.
COMMENTS FOLLOW SEPTEL. MISSION WOULD NOT FAVOR TABLING A SUPPLE-
MENTAL TEXT IN TOTO, BUT ONLY OF THOSE SECTIONS OF TEXT WHICH
DISCUSSION OF DRAFT GUIDANCE REVELAS TO BE NECESSARY FOR
TREATMENT IN SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT.
4. AS DELEGATION POINTS OUT, THERE MAY BE STILL OTHER ISSUES THAT
REQUIRE ATTENTION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ALLIED AGREEMENT ONDRAFT
GUIDANCE. MISSION BELIEVES THE U.S. SHOULD BE PREPARED TO ADDRESS THE
FULL RANGE OF MATTERS WHICH HAVE ARISEN TO DATE IN THE SPC AND
OTHER RELATED DISCUSSIONS WITH ALLIES.
5. A LIST OF CURRENT ISSUES AND MISSION PROPOSAL FOR DEALING
WITH THEMFOLLOWS:
I. CONTENT
A.WHAT ARE THE MILITARY IMPLICATIONS OF THE WITHDRAWAL
AND SUBSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE OPTION III ELEMENT?
--THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN THE SUPPLEMENT BY A
SUMMARY REFERENCE TO THE SHAPE ASSESSMENT. SHAPE VIEWS ARE
EXPECTED BY MC ON JUNE 30 AND COULD BE IN THE HANDS OF THE SPC
BY ABOUT 10 JULY. AFTER SPC DISCUSSION, DRAFTING OF SUMMARY
LANGUAGE WOULD TAKE PLACE IN CAUCUS. REQUEST THAT WASHINGTON
PREPARE A SHORT STATEMENT, POSSIBLY DRAWING UPON THE NUNN NUCLEAR
REPORT, FOR USE IN THE EVENT ALLIES DESIRE FURTHER ELABORATION
IN THE SUPPLEMENT ON THE IMPACT OF OPTION III ON DETERRENCE.
B. CAN WARHEADS RETURNED TO U.S. CONTROL AS A RESULT OF
POC CHANGES BE WITHDRAWN AS PART OF THE REDUCTION PACKAGE, OR
WILL THE 1,000 WARHEADS BE COMPRISED ONLY OF "THOSE AVAILABLE
FOR USE BY U.S. UNITS?"
--WE BELIEVE THAT RECEIPT OF REF C RESOLVES THIS PROBLEM,
AND CAN BE REFLECTED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE SUPPLEMENT. IF
WARHEAD ISSUE REQUIRES FURTHER WORK WE WOULD HANDLE IT IN THE
CAUCUS. NO FURTHER GUIDANCE REQUIRED.
C. WOULD SOME QRA AIRCRAFT BE REDUCED IN CONNECTION WITH
THE WITHDRAWAL OF 54 U.S. F-4'S?
--THIS ISSUE MAY ARISE IN THE COURSE OF EITHER SPC
OR CAUCUS DISCUSSION, AND MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT IN THE SUPPLE-
MENT. WE WOULD SEEK TO RESTRICT DISCUSSION TO THE CAUCUS.
REQUEST WASHINGTON PREPARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE IN THE SPC OR
THE CAUCUS ADDRESSING BOTH TARGET COVERAGE AND THE POSSIBILITY
OF ACTUAL REDUCTION OF QRA AIRCRAFT.
D. HOW QUICKLY COULD THE WITHDRAWN U.S. F-4S BE RETURNED
TO EUROPE?
--WE BELIEVE THIS ISSUE OF THE STATE OF READINESS OF
U.S. AIRCRAFT IN THE U.S. SHOULD NOT BE DEALT WITH IN EITHER
THE GUIDANCE OR THE SUPPLEMENT. REQUEST THAT WASHINGTON PREPARE
INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS POINT FOR ORAL USE IN THE SPC OR CAUCUS.
E. HOW CAN UNDESIRABLE PRECEDENT-SETTING EFFECTS OF OPTION
III FOR PHASE II BE AVOIDED?
--THE FRG AND OTHERS ARE CONCERNED THAT THE EAST WILL
CITE U.S. NUCLEAR WITHDRAWALS IN PHASE I AS A PRECEDENT FOR
FURTHER NUCLEAR REDUCTIONS IN PHASE II. WE BELIEVE THIS ISSUE
IS CERTAIN TO ARISE IN SOME FORM IN THE SPC. WE WOULD MAINTAIN
THAT PARA 9 OF THE U.S. DRAFT GUIDANCE IS ADEQUATE TO MEET THIS
POINT, BUT WE WILL NEED FURTHER WASHINGTON GUIDANCE AS TO WHAT,
IF ANYTHING, WE COLD AGREE TO SAY IN THE SUPPLEMENT.
II . OBJECTIVES
F. HOW SHOULD THE COMMITMENT TO THE COMMON CEILING IN
PHASE I BE SPECIFIED?
--THELANGUAGE IN PARAGRAPH ONE OF THE U.S. DRAFT GUIDANCE
SHOULD BO A LONG WAY TO MEETING THE UK CONCERN. THEUK MAY,
HOWEVER, INTRODUCE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE TO "APPRO
