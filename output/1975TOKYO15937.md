FERENCE IN SVN'S AFFAIRS BY OUTSIDE POWERS AND SUPPORTED RESOLU-
TION OF VN CONFLICT BY VIETNAMESE THEMSELVES. THIRDLY, ALTHOUGH JAPAN
HAD PROVIDED ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO FORMER GSVN, SUCH AS HOS-
PITALS AND POWER GENERATING EQUIPMENT, NO MILITARY EQUIPMENT OR
MATERIEL HAD BEEN PROVIDED. NEVERTHELESS, IF RGSVN DESIRED
NEGOTIATIONS FOR ESTABLISHMENT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS, JAPAN WAS
WILLING. ITO SUGGESTED THAT THEY PROCEED IMMEDIATELY AND THEN PRO-
DUCED DRAFT STATEMENT FROM HIS BRIEFCASE WORDED SIMPLY THAT JAPAN
AND PRG HAD AGREED TO ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AND TO
EXCHANGE AMBASSADORS AT AN EARLY DATE.
3. TIEN BRUSQUELY ANNOUNCED THAT EVEN THOUGH ITO'S DRAFT WAS
CUSTOMARY, DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WERE CONTINGENT ON AGREEMENT BY
GOJ TO THREE CONDITIONS:
A) INCLUSION IN COMMUNIQUE OF STATEMENT THAT BOTH SIDES WOULD
RESPECT THE PRINCIPLES OF INDEPENDENCE, SOVEREIGNTY AND NON-
INTEREFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER;
B) COMMUNIQUE SHOULD PLEDGE BOTH NOT TO PERMIT USE OF TERRITORY
TO THIRD PARTY FOR ATTACK AGAINST FOURTH PARTIES;
C) JAPAN MUST AGREE IN COMMUNIQUE TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC ASSI-
STANCE TO SVN.
ITO SAID NO FIGURE WAS MENTIONED BUT HE THOUGHT PRG REP MEANT
THAT AN AGREED AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE INDICATED IN
COMMUNIQUE.

4. IN RESPONSE, ITO CONTENDED THERE WAS NO REASON TO SELECT
"THREE PRINCIPLES" FOR INCLUSION IN COMMUNIQUE BUT HE SUGGESTED
THAT THIS PROBLEM COULD POSSIBLY BE RESOLVED BY REFERRING TO UN
CHARTER PRINCIPLES. ITO REJECTED SECOND DITION, (B) AS VIOLATION
OF PRINCIPLE OF SOVEREIGNTY. ITO ALSO RULED OUT CONDITION (C);
JAPAN WOULD CONSIDER ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO SVN AFTER DIP-
LOMATIC RELATIONS WITH SVN WERE ESTABLISHED ON SAME BASIS AS
JAPAN CONSIDERED ASSISTANCE TO OTHER UNDER-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.
AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE IN COMMUNIQUE ES-
TABLISHING RELATIONS (WHICH ITO CALLED "REPARATIONS") WAS OUT
OF QUESTION.
5. TIEN THEN VIGOROUSLY REITERATED HIS CHARGES, IN REACTION TO
WHICH ITO ASKED, "IT APPEARS THAT PRG WANTS JAPAN TO FULFILL THREE
CONDITIONS BUT DOES NOT WANT TO ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.
IF SO, THERE IS NO POINT IN CONTINUING THE DISCUSSIONS. IS MY
INTERPRETATION CORRECT?" TIEN RESPONDED HALF-LAUGHINGLY, "YES,"
BUT ADDED THAT HE ASSUMED BOTH SIDES WOULD CONVEY SUBSTANCE OF
TALKS TO HOME GOVERNMENTS. ITO AGREED. THERE WAS NO IMPLICATION,
ITO SAID, THAT FURTHER TALKS WERE SCHEDULED OR NECESSARILY EX-
PECTED. TALKS THEN ENDED.
6. ITO TOLD US GOJ POLICY TOWARD RELATIONS WITH RGSVN WOULD
REMAIN AS HE OUTLINED TO TIEN. IF SAIGON WISHED FURTHER DIS-
CUSSIONS, GOJ WOULD AGREE TO TALK, BUT TOKYO WOULD NOT ACCEPT
VIETNAMESE DEMANDS. AS REPORTED REF B, GOJ PLANS TO REDUCE
AND PROBABLY EVENTUALLY ELIMINATE STAFF IN SAIGON.
7. DISCUSSING REASONS FOR SAIGON'S TOUGH POSITION, ITO DESCRIBED
DRV AND SVN AS PUPPETS CONTROLLED BY SINGLE MAN. HANOI USED EITHER
PUPPET TO TAKE WHATEVER POSITION DESIRED. DESPITE FRIENDLY NOISES
FROM DRV, WHICH HAD JUST RECEIVED 13.5 BILLION YEN IN GRANT ASSIS-
TANCE FROM JAPAN (REF A), SAME AUTHORITY MADE TIEN TAKE TOUGH
LINE IN TALKS WITH JAPANESE. ITO EXPRESSED VIEW THAT EVEN THOUGH
VN IS BIENG UNIFIED, HANOI WILL MAINTAIN FICTION, FOR EXTERNAL
AFFAIRS PURPOSES, OF SEPARATE GOVERNMENT IN SVN TO TRY TO PRY
REPARATIONS AND AID COMMITMENTS FROM COUNTRIES WHICH HAD SUP-
PORTED FORMER GVN, ESPECIALLY JAPAN AND US. FICTION WOULD PRO-
BABLY BE MAINTAINED UTIL EITHER FUNDS WERE FORTHCOMING OR HANOI
DECIDED THAT CAUSE WAS HOPELESS.
8. AGAIN STRESSING SENSITIVITY OF HIS TALKS IN HANOI, ITO NOTED
THAT HE HAS SUCCEEDED THUS FAR IN DEEPING STORY OF TALKS WITH TIEN
OUT OF PRESS. ONLY USG WAS BEING BRIEFED ON HIS TALKS. DISCLOSURE
OF CONTENTS OF TALKS WOULD CA
