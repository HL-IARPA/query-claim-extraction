### Cable Body

```
1. I SAW GENERAL JACOB THIS EVENING NOVEMBER 3 AND HAD BRIEF
DISCUSSION WITH HIM ABOUT BANGLADESH (REPORTED BY SEPTEL) BUT
HE WAS CHIEFLY VERY WORKED UP ABOUT THE CHINESE ("THOSE BASTARDS").
THERE WAS NO DOUBT, HE SAID, THAT THE CHINESE HAD DELIBERATELY
SET UP AN AMBUSH FOR HIS MEN AND HAD AFTERWARDS JUST AS
DELIBERATELY MURDERED THE FOUR THEY CAPTURED; THIS WAS
PROVEN BY MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF THE BODIES. THEN THE CHINESE
HAD TRIED TO COVER UP BY FIRING BULLETS THROUGH THE RIFLES
OF THE FOUR DEAD MEN. JACOB SAID HE KNEW FROM THE ACCOUNT GIVEN
BY THE TWO WHO ESCAPED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO FIRING BY THE
INDIAN PATROL.
2. JACOB SAID THE PATROL WAS PART OF THE ASSAM RIFLES AND THE
INCIDENT TOOK PLACE IN THE TAWANG AREA (I SAID I HAD HEARD THAT
IT WAS IN SIKKIM; NO, JACOB SAID, DEFINITELY NOT, IT WAS
TAWANG). JACOB SAID HE STILL HAD NO IDEA WHY THE CHINESE
HAD DONE THIS "BRUTAL ACT OF MURDER."
3. I ASKED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NOW AND JACOB, BY THIS TIME
HAVING DIFFICULTY IN CONTROLLING HIS ANGER, SAID HE DIDN'T
KNOW BUT HE WOULD NOT FORGET WHAT HAD BEEN DONE TO HIS
SOLDIERS AND WOULD FIND A TIME AND A PLACE TO SETTLE HIS
ACCOUNT WITH THE CHINESE. HE ADDED QUICKLY THAT THIS WAS
SOMETHING HE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WANT TO BE QUOTED ON.
