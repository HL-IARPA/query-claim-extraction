B. MBFR VIENNA 33
C. USNATO 631
1. MISSION CONSIDERS THAT VIENNA'S PROPOSED MODIFICATION
(REFS A AND B )OF THE U.S. PROPOSAL ON AIR MANPOWER WOULD
MAKE THAT PROPOSAL MORE SALEABLE WITH THE ALLIES.
2. MISSION BELIEVES THAT THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF VIENNA'S MODIFICATION
WITH THE ALLIES IS ITS IMPACT ON THE PRECEDENT ISSUE. THAT ISSUE
IS LARGELY AN FRG CONCERN. FRG CONTINUES TO SEE
A PRECEDENT IN THE U.S. PROPOSAL, FROM TWO STANDPOINTS: FIRST,
U.S. ANDSOVIET AIR MANPOWER REDUCTIONS IN PHASE I WOULD LEAD TO
(NON-VOLUNATRY) INCLUSION OF EUROPEAN AIR MANPOWER IN PAHSE II
REDUCTIONS; AND SECOND, THAT REDUCTION OF EUROPEAN AIR MAPOWER
IN PHASE II WOUOLD BE BY UP TO 15 PERCENT. THE VIENNA PROPOSAL
COULD HELP MEET THE FRG CONCERN FROM THE FIRST STANDPOINT, IN
THAT THE VIENNA PROPOSAL OFFERS TO THE EAST VOLUNTARY REPEAT
VOLUNTARY AIR MANPOWER REDUCTION IN PHASE II,AND PROVIDES SOME
DETAIL IN DOING SO (SEE PARA 3, REF C). HOWEVER, EVEN IF THE
VIENNA PROPOSAL DOES NOT MEET FRG CONCERN FROM THE FIRST STAND-
POINT, AND THE FRG REMAINS CONVINCED THAT A PRECEDENT FOR INCLUSION
OF EUROPEAN AIR MANPOWER IN PHASE II REDUCTIONS IS ESTABLISHED,
THE PRECEDENT THAT NO MORE THAN 10 PERCENT OF FRG PAHSE II
REDUCTIONS BE IN AIR MANPOWER WOULD CUT MUCH LESS DEEPLY THAN A
PRECEDENT FOR A 15 PERCENT REDUCTION OF FRG OR NON-US ALLIED AIR
MANPOWER.
3. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF THE VIENNA MODIFICATION IS THATIT
WOULD MEET THE CONCERN OF SOME ALLIES THAT THE U.S. COULD NOT
TAKE PHASE I AIR MANPOWER REDUCTIONS OF UP TO 15 PERCENT WITHOUT
REDUCING COMBAT CAPABILITY. THE GREATER NEGOTIABILITY OF THE
VIENNA MODIFICATION MAY HELP MEET A UK CONCERN. THEY EXPRESSED CONCERN
EARLY IN THE SPC DISCUSSION ABOUT THE
NEGOTIABILITY OF A PROPOSAL WHICH REQUIRED FEWER ALLIED
REDUCTIONS AND MORE PACT REDUCTIONS THATTHE ORIGINAL ALLIED
PROPOSAL.
4. THE MAIN ALLIED QUESTION CONCERNING THE VIENNA PROPOSAL WOULD
BE ITS EFFECT ON WITHDRAWAL OF A TANK ARMY IN PHASE I. THE U.S.
WOULD NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROPOSAL IS COMPATIBLE WITH
THAT ALLIED PHASE I OBJECTIVE, EVEN THOUGH SOVIET PHASE I
GROUND FORCE REDUCTIOS WOULD AMOUNT TO A MINIMUMOF ABOUT
61,000, INSTEAD OF THE FIGURE OF "ABOUT 68,000" ORIGINALLY
ENVISAGED. THE ALLIES WOULD ALSO QUESTION THE EXTENT TO WHICH
THE VIENNA PROPOSL MAINTAINS THE FOCUS ON GROUND FORCE REDUCTIONS.
THE U.S. WOULD HAVE A STRONG ARGUMENT IN THE RELATIVELY SMALL
AMOUNT OF AIR MANPOWER REDUCTIONS.HOWEVER, SOME ALLIES MIGHT SEE
STRONGER ARGUMENT IS DEFENSE OF THE GROUND FORCE FOCUS IN THE
PRESENT U.S. PROPOSAL, I.E.  THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE AT LEAST THE
68,000 SOVIET GROUND FORCE REDUCTIONS ORIGINALLY ENVISAGED AND
POSSIBLY MORE.
5. MISSION RECOMMENDS THAT , IF WASHINGTON DECIDES IN FAVOR OF
THE VVIENNA MODIFICATION, THE U.S. PRESENT IT AS AN EFFORT TO
MEET ALLIED CONCERNS, AND WORK FOR EARLY AGREEMENT ON IT, WITHOUT
WITHDRAWING THE PRESENT U.S. PROPOSAL. THIS WOULD GIVE US AN
AOPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS ALLIED REACTION TO THE NEW PROPOSAL WITHOUT
FORECLOSING OPTION OF MOVING AHEAD WITH THE PRESENT PROPOSAL IF,
CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATION, THE ALLIES PREFER IT TO THEVIENNA
MODIFICATION.IN ANY EVENT, PRESENT U.S. PROPOSAL, WHICH IS NOW
SUPPORTED BY DUTCH, WILL REMAIN BEFORE THE SPC, AS HAS EARLIER
U.S. PROPOSAL ON INCLUSION OF AIR MANPOWER IN THE COMMON CELING
WITHOUT REDUCTIONS WHICH IS NOW SUPPORTED BY FRG.
6. MISSION ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT WASHINGTON COME TO AN EARLY
DECISION ON THE VIENNA MODIFICATION. IF WASHINGTON SHOULD
DECIDE TO PROPOSE IT IN NATO,IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DO SO BEFORE
WORK IN NATO AND  IN ALLIED CAPITALS ON PRESENT U.S. POROPSAL
PROGRESSES FURTHER.
