SUMMARY: THE PURCHASE OF NEW TWINJET AIRCRAFT BY
OLYMPIC APPEARS STALLED. ACCORDING TO EMBASSY IN-
FORMATION, THIS IS AT LEAST IN PART THE RESULT OF NEW BRITISH
INITIATIVES IN LONDON AND ATHENS. SHOULD THE DELAY
CONTINUE A OLYMPIC MAY BUY NO NEW AIRCRAFT AT ALL
THIS YEAR. AMBASSADOR CALLED MINISTER OF
COORDINATION PAPALIGOURAS TO EXPRESS USG CONCERN
OVER CONTINUING DELAY. PAPALIGOURAS RENEWED ASSURANCES
THAT POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS WOULD NOT REPEAT
NOT BE ALLOWED TO INTERVENT IN GOG DECISION IN A MANNER
UNVAVORABLE TO U.S., BUT HE STOPPED SHORT OF SAYING
THAT GOG WOULD NOW PURCHASE US AIRCRAFT
AS RECOMMENDED BY GOG'S OWN EVALUATION COM-
MITTEE. ACGION REQUESTED: EMBASSY RECOMMENDS SIMILAR
APPROACH TO GREEK AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON SAP.
END SUMMARY.
1. EMBASSY HAS LEARNED FROM VARIOUS RELIABLE
SOURCES THAT BRITISH ARE MOUNTING MAJOR EFFORT TO
SWING FINAL DECISION THEIR WAY OR BLOCK SALE ENTIRELY
UNTIL FURTHER MANAGEMENT CHANGES TAKE PLACE AT OLYMPIC.
INITIATIVES TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS:
A) PRESS CAMPAIGN (REFTEL A)
B) PARLIAMENTARY CRITICISM (REFTEL A)
C) NEW OFFERS: EMBASSY OFFICER HAS SEEN COPY OF
NEW OFFER, DATED 17 JANUARY, FROM BAC STATING THAT
PAYMENT OF $10 MILLION OF PURCHASE PRICE COULD BE
EFFECTED THROUGH TRIANGULAR TRANSACTION VIA SOME UN-
SPECIFIED COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO THE LETTER, THE
ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE HANDLED BY BAC. ANOTHER LETTER,
DATED 19 JANUARY, IMPROVES OFFER WITH REGARD TO
ENGINE SPARES.
D) DIPLOMATIC: EMBASSY OFFICER WAS READ CABLE
FROM GREEK AMBASSADOR ROUSSOS IN LONDON TO FOREIGN
MINISTRY IN ATHENS RELATING HOW HE WAS CALLED TO
BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE BY HEAD OF SOUTH EUROPEAN
OFFICE GOODISON (PHON.) WHO PRESENTED DEMARCHE IN
FAVOR OF BAC ONE-ELEVEN, STATING THAT PROSPECTIVE
MEMBERS OF THE EEC COULD BE EXPECTED TO DEMONSTRATE
THEIR GOODWILL.
E) PERSONAL ATTACK: ACCORDING TO CHAIRMAN OF
OLYMPIC BOARD THEOPHANOUS, RUMORS OF COLLUSION BETWEEN
BOEING AND CURRENT OLYMPIC MANAGEMENT ARE BEING CIR-
CULATED BY BAC'S GREEK LAWYER LYCOUREZOS.
2. AS STATED REFTEL (B), RECOMMENDATION BY AIR-
CRAFT EVALUATION COMMITTEE WAS UNANIMOUSLY FOR BOEING
737. ACCORDING TO LATER INFORMATION, MCDONNEL
DOUGLAS WAS CLOSE SECOND, BAC ONE-ELEVEN DISTANT THIRD.
THEREFORE, ANY NEW BRITISH OFFER WOULD HAVE TO ENABLE
BAC TO OVERCOME OVERWHELMING LEAD ON THE PART OF US
MANUFACTURERS. ACCORDING TO VARIOUS EMBASSY SOURCES,
BRITISH UNDERSTAND THIS, BUT BELEIVE NEW OFFERS, IF
THEY DO NOT FURTHER SALE OF BAC ONE-ELEVEN, WOULD AT
LEAST HOLP STOP PURCHASE OF US AIRCRAFT BY ADDING TO
DELAY. CANCEL OF PURCHASE AT THIS TIME WOULD ENABLE
BAC TO MAKE RENEWED EFFORT IF AND WHEN OLYMPIC
MANAGEMENT CHANGES (PRESENT BOARD STILL OFFICIALLY
TEMPORARY). OLYPMIC PRESENTLY RELYING ON LEASING
ARRANGMENTS MADE BY AIRCRAFT VENDORS AS PART OF
THEIR OFFERS TO FILL SUMMER 1976 REQUIREMENTS. NOT
ONLY DO US AIRCRAFT MANURACTUREERS FIND IT INCREASINGLY
DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN THOSE ARRANGEMENTS, BUT IN
THE ABSENCE OF A GOG DECISION OLYPMIC WILL SOON HAVE
TO CANCEL PURCHASE AND TURN TO OPEN MARKET FOR NEW
LEASING ARRANGMENTTS IN ORDER TO FULFILL THEIR
COMMITMENTS TO TRAVEL AGENCIES.
3. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE AMBASSADOR
CALLED COORDINATION MINISTER PAPALIGOURAS TO RESTATE
STRONG US INTEREST IN THIS TRANSACTION.
THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THAT MAJOR EFFORT WAS MADE
BY USG/EXIMBANK TO OFFER MOST LIBERAL FINANCIAL TERMS POSSIBLE.
PAPALIGOURAS SAID HE HAD NOT YET READ THE AIRCRAFT
EVALUATION COMMITTEE'S REPORT, BUT ADMITTED THAT HE
HAD HEARD THAT THE REPORT RECOMMENDED A US MANUFACTURER.
PAPALIGOURAS CONCEDED THAT THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR HAD
ALSO BEEN IN TOUCH WITH HIM, BUT HE ASSERTED THAT HE PERSONALLY
WOULD NOT REPEAT NOT ALLOW POLITICAL ARGUMENTS TO
INFLUENCE GOG DECISION IN A MANNER UNFAVORABLE TO U.S. PAPALIGOURAS
STOPPED SHORT OF SAYING THAT A US AIRPLANE WOULD BE CHOSEN,
BUT HE DID SAY THAT HE EXPECTED A FINAL DECISION SOON.
4. ACTION REQUESTED: EMBASSY RECOMMENDS THAT
DEPARTMENT ALSO EMPHASIZE TO GREEK AMABSSADOR IN WASH-
INTON ASAP STRONG US INTEREST IN THIS IS
