NATO AEW
(D) USNATO 5984; (E) BONN 18558; (F) LONDON 17773
BEGIN SUMMARY:  IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT A MORE INTENSIVE
EFFORT WILL BE NEEDED TO INDUCE THE FRG TO BE MORE
FORTHCOMING ABOUT AWACS AT THE DECEMBER DPC
MINISTERIAL.  FOR THAT REASON, WE ENDORSE EMBASSY
LONDON'S SUGGESTION (REF A) THAT WASHINGTON CONSIDER
A PERSONAL INTERVENTION BY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
RUMSFELD DIRECTLY WITH LEBER, EITHER AT THE MARGIN
OF THE FORTHCOMING NPG OR THROUGH A PERSONAL APPROACH
BY MYSELF TO MINISTER LEBER.  WE CANNOT, HOWEVER,
ENDORSE EMBASSY LONDON'S RECOMMENDATION THAT IT BE
AUTHORIZED TO INFORM THE UK OF THE PROPOSED DEMARCHE.
BRITISH-GERMAN FRICTION ON ALLIANCE MILITARY
MATTERS IS CURRENTLY ON THE RISE, AND IT MAKES
LITTLE SENSE FOR US TO GET IN THE MIDDLE.  END SUMMARY.
1.  DURING THE NOVEMBER 3 DINNER GIVEN BY MINISTER
LEBER IN HONOR OF SENATORS NUNN AND BARTLETT, HE TOLD
ME THAT HE WAS CONVINCED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AEW
SYSTEM AND THAT HE WAS POSITIVELY DISPOSED TOWARDS THE
CONCEPT.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FRG LACKED CONFIDENCE
THAT AWACS WOULD FUNCTION AS INTENDED.
2.  LEBER'S REMARKS CONFIRMED PREVIOUS EMBASSY REPORT-
ING (E.G., REFS B AND C) THAT THE FRG REMAINS UNCON-
VINCED THAT AWACS IS SUFFICIENTLY WELL DEVELOPED OR
COST-STUDIED TO WARRANT A NATO COMMITMENT TO PURCHASE
IT AT THIS TIME.  A PERSONAL APPROACH TO LEBER FROM
SECRETARY RUMSFELD WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE BEST HOPE
OF CHANGING THIS FRG POSITION.
3.  SHOULD A DIRECT APPROACH TO LEBER BE AUTHORIZED,
WE  URGE THAT IT NOT ONLY REPEAT THE POINTS MADE IN OUR
RECENT AIDE MEMOIRE BUT ADDRESS DIRECTLY THE THREE
MATTERS WHICH CHIEFLY CONCERN THE GERMANS AND WHICH,
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LAST, WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING
FOR SOME TIME.
A.  THE FIRST OF THESE IS THE SCHEDULING OF
PAYMENTS.  THE FRG HAS HEAVY COMMITMENTS FOR MAJOR
WEAPONS PROCUREMENT COMING DUE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.
IT WOULD EASE MATTERS CONSIDERABLY FOR THE FRG IF ITS
PARTICIPATION WERE TO INVOLVE SMALLER PAYMENTS IN THE
INITIAL YEARS OF AN AEW PROGRAM BALANCED BY LARGER
PAYMENTS IN THE LATER YEARS.  WE SUGGESTED THIS SEVERAL
MONTHS AGO, AND IT APPEARED TO BE ACCEPTED, BUT WE HAVE
HEARD NOTHING OF IT RECENTLY.
B. SECOND, THE FRG HAS   EMPHASIZED THAT A
NATO AEW PROGRAM MUST BE A TRULY NATO EFFORT, NOT ONE
OF A FEW NATO ALLIES.  THE FRG HAS, WE UNDERSTAND, BEEN
URGING OTHER NATO STATES TO PARTICIPATE.  ANY APPROACH
TO MINISTER LEBER SHOULD BE AS FORTHCOMING AS POSSIBLE
REGARDING THE LIKELIHOOD OF PARTICIPATION BY OTHER NATO
ALLIES INCLUDING THE UK, AND SHOULD SPECIFICALLY
INDICATE WHAT COMMITMENTS WE THINK WE HAVE.
C.  REFTEL D ADDRESSED THE THIRD MAJOR GERMAN
CONCERN: THAT IS, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITIES OF
INCORPORATING A NATO AEW INTO THE CURRENT GROUND SYSTEM.
THE TEXT OF THE PAPER CONTAINED IN THAT TELEGRAM IS
TOO TECHNICAL TO BE USED WITH MINISTER LEBER.  AN
APPROACH AT HIS LEVEL SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT GERMAN
CONCERNS IN THIS FIELD ARE BEING ADDRESSED BY THE
EXPERTS IN NATO AND THAT THE US IS CONFIDENT THAT FRG
FEARS CAN BE LAID TO REST.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE SHOULD
PURSUE THE MATTER VIGOROUSLY IN NATO, RECALLING THAT
THE GERMANS (REF C) HAVE TOLD US THEY THOUGHT A STUDY
COULD BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE DECEMBER MINISTERIAL.
4.  WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT SUCH AN APPROACH TO
LEBER WILL TURN THE GERMAN POSITION AROUND.  AS WE HAVE
INDICATED BEFORE, THE GERMAN MILITARY SERVICES ARE
UNIFORMLY OPPOSED TO AWACS BECAUSE THEY REGARD IT AS A
THREAT TO THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY ENDORSED
AND BUDGETED.  THE CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN UNABLE
TO OVERCOME THE RELUCTANCE OF THE SERVICES, AND
APPARENTLY FEARS THAT THE SERVICES WILL USE THEIR
CONNECTIONS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ATTACK ANY GOVERNMENT
PROPOSAL FOR HEAVY AWACS FUNDING.
5.  IN FACT, GIVEN THE OPPOSITION AMONG THE UNIFORMED
SERVICES, WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS PERHAPS MOST REMARK-
ABLE ABOUT THE GERMAN POSITION IS THAT THE FRG HAS NOT
BEEN TOTALLY HOSTILE TO AWACS.  WE BELIEVE THIS REFLECTS
THE FRG'S DESIRE FOR CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE US, ITS
RELUCTANCE TO VOICE A
