(C) FORIGNERS RUMORED TO HAVE SOLD EVIDENCE LEADING TO WEI CONVICTION
1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT.
2.  CHINESE SOURCES HAVE TOLD FOREIGN EXPERTS HERE
THAT SOME CHINEESE OFFICIALS BELIEVE THE "FOREIGNER
GUO LI" (WILLIAM GUO, A FORMER VISNEWS EMPLOYEE)
SOLD EVIDENCE AGAINST "COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY" WEI
JINGSHENG TO CHINESE OFFICIALS FOR ONE MILLION
DOLLARS. ACCORDING TO THE STORY, GUO SOLD A TAPE
RECORDING OF WEI REVEALING "MILITARY INTELLIGENCE"
TO EEUTER'S CORRESPONDENT IAN MACKENZIE, EVIDENCE
THAT WAS USED TO CONVICT WEI IN HIS OCT. 16 TRIAL  (REFS).
3.  COMMENT:   WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE SUCH
A TRANSACTION TAKING PLACE, THE GENERAL BELIEF AMONG
WEI'S FRIENDS AND OTHER LEADING DISSIDENTS IS THAT
ONE OR MORE FOREIGNERS PROVIDED EVIDENCE AGAINST WEI
TO CHINESE PUBLIC SECURITY OFFICIALS. THE EXPERTS,
AND THEIR CONTACTS, BELIEVE THE STORY IS BEING OFFICIALLY
ENCOURAGED AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT
IN THE DISSIDENT MOVEMENT AS WELL AS THE UNRELIABILITY
AND THE DANGER OF CONTACTS WITH FOREIGNERS.
