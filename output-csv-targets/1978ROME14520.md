LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORIST INCIDENT
1. WE FOLLOWED UP EARLIER DEMARCHE (REF B) WITH MFA DIRECTOR
FOR MIDDLE EASTERN AFFAIRS SANTARELLI AUGUST 7. SANTARELLI
SAID THAT WHEN FRENCH INFORMED ITALIANS ABOUT ORIGIN OF WEAPONS
USED IN TERRORIST INCIDENT AT ORLY, MFA INSTRUCTED ITALIAN
AMBASSADOR IN TRIPOLI TO RAISE ISSUE WITH LIBYANS. WHILE GOL HAS
NOT YET RESPONDED TO DEMARCHE, ITALIANS ARE SATISIFED THAT, AT
THE LEAST, GOL KNOWS THAT GOI KNOWS OF LIBYAN SUPPLY OF ITALIAN
ARMS TO TERRORISTS. SANTARELLI CAUTIONED THAT FOREGOING, CON-
SIDERED VERY SENSITIVE IN GOI, IS FOR USG INFORMATION ONLY
AND SHOULD NOT BE DISCUSSED WITH ITALIAN DIPLOMATS ELSEWHERE
OR WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS.
2. AS TO JOINT DEMARCHE, SANTARELLI SAID MFA IS NOT
CLEAR ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT IS INTENDED. WHILE ITALIANS
ARE NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO IDEA OF FURTHER DEMARCHE,
THEY FEEL THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY REGISTERED THEIR
REACTION IN BILATERAL APPROACH.
3. AS STATED REF B, FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REASONS
WE DO NOT BELIEVE ITALIANS WOULD BE WILLING TO JOIN IN
"TOUGH DEMARCHE" TO LIBYANS ON THIS ISSUE. FROM THEIR
POINT OF VIEW, THEY HAVE ALREADY TAKEN COURAGEOUS STEP
IN CONFRONTING GOL WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF WEAPONS
SUPPLY, AND THEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO WANT TO PURSUE IT WITH
GOL ANY FURTHER. HOLMES
