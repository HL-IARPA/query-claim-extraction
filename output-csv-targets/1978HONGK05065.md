HONG KONG GOVERNMENT ATTITUDES TOWARD SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS
B) STATE 36614
1. ALTHOUGH THE REFERENCED INR REPORT DID NOT MENTION HONG
KONG SPECIFICALLY, THE HONG KONG GOVERNMENT'S (HKG) VIEWS
ON SINO-US RELATIONS AND NORMALIZATION WERE SICCINTCTLY
SUMMARIZED RECENTLY BY THE HKG POLITICAL ADVISOR. HE SAID
THAT AS CHINA'S RELATIONS WITH THE US AND THE WEST IN
GENERAL HAVE IMPROVED, HONG KONG'S INTERACTION WITH CHINA
HAS BECOME EASIER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE.
2.THE POLAD BELIEVED NORMALIZATION WOULD NEITHER
DIRECTLY BENEFIT NOR AFFECT HONG KONG UNLESS THE PRC TOOK
ACTION AGAINST TAIWAN.  A CHINESE ATTACK OR EVEN THREAT
THEREOF WOULD CAUSE A MASSIVE CAPITAL HEMORRHAGE
FROM HONG KONG WHICH COULD IRREVERSIBLY DESTABLIIZE
THE COLONY.  HE ADDED THAT HE DID NOT EXPECT SUCH A
PRC MOVE IN THE NEAR TERM.  HE ALSO THOUGH PEKING WOULD
CONCENTRATE ON REINCORPORATING TAIWAN IN OTHER WAYS
BEFORE TURNING TO THE QUESTION OF HONG KONG AND
MACAU.
