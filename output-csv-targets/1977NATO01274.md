C. 76 BRUSSELS 12689 DTG 271142Z DEC 76 NOTAL
1.  AMBASSADOR MET WITH STAFFDEL MORNING OF MARCH 7
TO DISCUSS POLITICAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO POSSIBLE
EUCOM MOVE TO SHAPE, STRESSING PARTICULARLY:
--- THE NEED TO CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM OF AN
APPARENT "AMERICANIZATION" OF SHAPE;
---POSSIBLE ALLIED PERCEPTIONS OF AN "AMERICANIZATION" OF THE
ALLIANCE AS A WHOLE SHOULD A MOVE BE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT FULL
CONSULTATION AND ALLIANCE SUPPORT;
---THE NEED FOR CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS
FOR BELGIUM OF A MOVE, PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHEN THE TINDEMANS
GOVERNMENT HAS MINORITY STATUS;
---POSSIBLE FRG CONCERNS AS OUTLINED IF REF A.
2.  THE AMBASSADOR HIGHLIGHTED FOR MESSRS. TALLEY AND GIES THE
GENERALLY WEAK POLITICAL POSITIONS OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE
ALLIANCE AND THEIR STRONG DESIRE AT PRESENT TO BE CONSULTED FULLY
REGARDING CHANGES IN PLANS AND POLICIES WHICH WASHINGTON MAY BE
CONTEMPLATING.  HE URGED THAT FULL AND CAREFUL CONSIDERATION BE
GIVEN TO THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF A MOVE AT THIS TIME AS
AGAINST A TIME WHEN ALLIANCE GOVERNMENTS ARE STRONGER.
3.  WHILE URGING THE STAFFDEL TO SEEK THE VIEWS OF EMBASSY CHARGE
RENNER, THE AMBASSADOR DREW ON HIS PERSPECTIVE AS A FORMER AMBASSADOR
TO BELGIUM TO OUTLINE THE QUESTIONS HE VELIEVED THE GOVERNMENT OF
BELGIUM WOULD FEEL COMPELLED TO CONSIDER WHEN REVIEWING ANY
POSSIBLE COLLOCATION PROPOSALS (REF C).  HE NOTED THE PRINCIPAL
REASONS WHY THE GOB MAY BE RELUCTANT TO GRASP THE COLLOCATION
NETTLE AT THIS POINT.
4.  AS REQUESTED REF B., WE REMINDED MESSRS. TALLEY AND GIES THAT
NO DECISION HAS YET BEEN MADE BY THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS ISSUE
AND THAT IT IS A POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE ONE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN
EXPLORED WITH OUR ALLIES.
5.  COMMENT:  TALLEY AND GIES INDICATED THAT THEY ARRIVED IN EUROPE
WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE APPRECIATION OF THE POLITICAL FACTORS
RELATED TO A EUCOM MOVE TO BELGIUM.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE WERE ABLE
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROCESS WHICH EMBASSY BONN BEGAN OF ENLARGING
THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE POLITICAL FACTORS AND SENSITIVITIES
INVOLVED,  WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOTING THE REASONING WHICH MAKE
COLLOCATION OPERATIONALLY ATTRACTIVE.  TALLEY AND GIES APPEARED
CONCERNED THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL FUNDING PROCESS MAY OUTPACE THE
PROCESS OF POLITICAL CONSULTATIONS WITH BELGIUM, THE FRG, AND
OTHER ALLIES.  IF THIS IS A RESULT OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH ACTION, WE
BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR TO ALL THE RELEVANT MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS AND STAFFS THAT NO DECISIONS ON COLLOCATION HAVE BEEN
MADE AND THAT DISCUSSION OF FUNDING IS THUS PREMATURE.  MOREOVER,
THE POLITICAL SENSITIVITY OF THE ISSUE USEFULLY COULD BE UNDERLINED.
END COMMENT.
6.  STAFFDEL PLANS TO RETURN TO USNATO FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS
MARCH 11, AND WE WILL REPORT ANY POINTS OF NOTE FOLLOWING
SECOND VISIT. STRAUSZ-HUPE
