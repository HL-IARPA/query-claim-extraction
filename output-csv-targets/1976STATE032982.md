MALTA - ANNUAL POLICY ASSESSMENT 1976
1.  SUMMARY:  1976 IS ELECTION YEAR IN MALTA.  AFTER FIVE
YEARS OF MINTOFF'S FLAMBOYANT LEADERSHIP, THE MALTESE MUST
NOW DECIDE WHICH OF THEIR TWO POLITICAL PARTIES WILL BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR SEEKING SOLUTIONS TO THEIR COUNTRY'S
ENDEMIC ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AS THE BRITISH MILITARY
WITHDRAWAL BEGINS.  BOTH MINTOFF'S LABORITES AND THE
OPPOSITION NATIONALISTS BELIEVE THAT MALTA'S STRATEGIC
MEDITERRANEAN LOCATION WILL STILL BE SUFFICIENTLY
VALUABLE TO NATO TO JUSTIFY CONTINUTION AFTER 1979 OF
SOME FORM OF ANNUAL MONETARY SUBSIDY.  WE HAVE SERIOUS
DOUBTS THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE.  BUT, IN ANY EVENT,
IT WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR THE USG AND NATO TO REACH
CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING MALTA'S FUTURE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AFTER THE 1976 ELECTIONS, IF WE ARE TO AVOID
ANOTHER CRISIS MANAGEMENT EXERCISE RESULTING FROM
MALTESE BLACKMAILING TACTICS.  BILATERAL U.S.
INTERESTS IN MALTA HAVE BEEN, AND WILL REMAIN,
LIMITED.  AND IF NATO'S SOUTHERN TIER REMAINS
INTACT, IT MAY WELL BE THAT MALTA IN THE 1980'S
MIGHT NOT MATTER THAT MUCH TO THE OTHER ALLIANCE
MEMBERS EITHER.  IF SO, THIS WILL COME AS A RUDE
SHOCK TO THE MALTESE.  END SUMMARY.
2.  THE SETTING:  MALTA IN 1976
AFTER ALMOST FIVE YEARS UNDER THE DYNAMIC LEADER-
SHIP OF PRIME MINISTER DOM MINTOFF, MALTA HAS REACHED
A CROSSROADS.  1976 IS ELECTION YEAR IN THIS SMALL
MEDITERRANEAN CITY-STATE.  THE 325,000 MALTESE APPEAR
TO BE FAIRLY EVENLY DIVIDED BETWEEN SUPPORT FOR
MINTOFF'S SOCIALIST, RATHER PRAGMATIC LABOR PARTY
AND THE CONVSERVATIVE, FREE ENTERPRISE-ORIENTED
OPPOSITION NATIONALIST PARTY UNDER FORMER PRIME
MINISTER GIORGIO BORG OLIVIER.
THE ELECTION WHICH BROUGHT MINTOFF TO POWER IN
THE SUMMER OF 1971 WAS A VERY CLOSE ONE AND THE
"IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE" SYNDROME WAS LARGELY
RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ELCTION.  NOW, AFTER MUCH
EXPERIENCE WITH MINTOFF'S FLAMBOYANT, "ONE-MAN SHOW"
STYLE LEADERSHIP, THE MALTESE MUST DECIDE WHETHER
THEY WANT ANOTHER FIVE YEARS OF MINTOFF'S ANTICS,
OR WHETHER THEY PREFER A RETURN TO THE QUIETER
DAYS OF NATIONALIST PARTY ADMINISTRATION.
THE MALTESE PARLIAMENT'S MANDATE EXPIRES IN
AUGUST 1976, AND A GENERAL ELECTION IS REQUIRED
WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF DISSOLUTION, OR BY NOVEMBER
1976.  IT IS PROBABLE THAT MINTOFF WILL CALL THE
ELECTION IN THE LATE SUMMER OR EARLY FALL, WHENEVER
HE DECIDES THE TACTICAL ADVANTAGE FOR THE LABOR
PARTY IS GREATEST.  BOTH SIDES ARE READY FOR THE
CONTEST, AND ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE SHOWDOWN.
FORECASTS OF THE ELECTION OUTCOME ARE MANY,
AND ALL HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE.  THERE WILL BE A
LARGE NUMBER OF NEW, UNTESTED VOTERS PARTICIPATING
IN THE 1976 ELECTION.  (SINCE 1971, THE VOTING
AGE IN MALTA HAS BEEN LOWERED FROM 21 TO 18.)
SOME 40,000 MALTESE OUT OF A TOTAL ELECTORATE OF
210,000 WILL BE VOTING FOR THE FIRST TIME.  THERE
HAVE BEEN NO BY-ELECTIONS IN FIVE YEARS, AND THERE
ARE NO PUBLIC OPINION POLLS IN MALTA.  AS A RESULT,
THE 1976 OUTCOME IS PROBLEMATICAL.  THE GENERAL
BELIEF IS THAT NEITHER PARTY WILL WIN WITH A LARGE
MAJORITY.  PREDICTIONS RANGE FROM A FIVE-SEAT LABOR
MARGIN TO  A FIVE-SEAT  ATIONALIST ONE (THERE WILL
BE A TOTAL OF 651 PARLIAMENTARY SEATS CONTESTED FOR
5#3 7,8:-.34-) #97 3 9* 43043 3,5-58;3 ), WITH BOTH
PARTIES PROFESSING CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL COME
OUT ON TOP.
AT THIS STAGE, BEFORE THE REAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN
BEGINS, THE EMBASSY LEANS TO THE VIEW THAT MINTOFF
AND THE LABOR PARTY PROBABLY WILL BE REELECTED IN A
VERY CLOSE CONTEST.  HOWEVER, MINTOFF HAS STEPPED
ON MANY TOES, AND WE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED AT A
NATIONALIST VICTORY.  THEREFORE, THIS ASSESSMENT
TAKES BOTH PTSSIBILITIES INTO ACCOUNT.
AS FAR AS U.S. INTERESTS HERE ARE CONCENED, WE
SHOULD (WITHIN REASON) BE ABLE TO WORK WITH EITHER
ANOTHER LABOR GOVERNMENT, OR WITH A NEW NATIONALIST
GOVERNMENT, DURING THE CRUCIAL POST ELECTION PERIOD
WHEN MALTA'S FUTURE MUST BE DETERMINED'  IF IT IS
TT BE FIVE MORE YEARS OF MINTOFF'S ACTIVIST BUT
ERRATIC LEADERSHIP, AT LEAST WE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE
AND DEAL WITH HIM, AND HE IS NOT NEARLY AS MUCH OF
AN UNKNOWN
