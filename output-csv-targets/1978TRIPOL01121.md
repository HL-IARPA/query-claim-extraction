LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORIST INCIDENT
1. WE SHARE DEPT'S INTEREST IN OBTAINING ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION RE LIBYAN ROLE IN ORLY AIRPORT TERRORIST
INCIDENT. THUS FAR ONLY INFORMATION WE HAVE SEEN IN
TRAFFIC HAS BEEN THAT ARMS USED BY TERRORISTS WERE AT
UNKNOWN TIME PURCHASED FROM ITALY BY LIBYA. WHILE A
DEMARCHE COULD BE MADE ON THE BASIS OF THIS
INFORMATION, THE LIBYANS COULD EASILY SIDE-STEP ISSUE
BY OBSERVING THAT THEIR LONG-TERM SUPPORT FOR
PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE MOVEMENTS, INCLUDING PROVISION
OF ARMS, IS NO SECRET AND THAT HOW PALESTINIANS' USE
SUCH ARMS IS NOT LIBYAN RESPONSIBILITY. IT WOULD BE
ANOTHER THING, HOWEVER, IF WE HAD INFORMATION THAT
LIBYANS HAD ARMED TERRORISTS SPECIFICALLY FOR ORLY
OPERATIONS OR THAT ARMS HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED TO FRANCE
BY LIBYANS.
2. IF EVIDENCE IS OBTAINED OF SUCH DIRECT LIBYAN
INVOLVEMENT, WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT EMBASSY TRIPOLI
JOIN IN DEMARCHE TO LIBYAN GOVERNMENT. ONE OF OUR
PROBLEMS HERE HAS BEEN ABSENCE OF CONVINCING EVIDENCE
LINKING LIBYAN GOVT WITH RECENT TERRORIST INCIDENTS
WHICH COULD BE CITED AS JUSTIFICATION FOR BAN ON EXPORT
TO LIBYA OF OSHKOSH TRUCKS, AND ANNOUNCEMENT OF
RESTRICTION ON BOEINGS. OUR POLICY WOULD BE BETTER
UNDERSTOOD BY THOSE WITHIN LIBYAN GOVT WHO SAY THEY ARE
WORKING FOR IMPROVED US-LIBYAN RELATIONS IF WE WERE
ABLE TO CITE HARD INFORMATION RE LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT AT
ORLY.
3. IF, HOWEVER, WE FIND THAT LIBYAN PARTICIPATION WAS
LIMITED TO ORIGINAL PURCHASE OF ARMS, PERHAPS SOME
TIME AGO, A DEMARCHE HERE WOULD CARRY LITTLE WEIGHT.
LIBYANS WOULD CONSIDER THEMSELVES VICTIMS OF A HOSTILE
CAMPAIGN BASED ON CONNECTION WITH ORLY ATTACK NO MORE
DIRECT THAN THAT OF TUNISIANS WHO REPORTEDLY FURNISHED
PASSPORTS.
