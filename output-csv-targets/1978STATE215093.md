FRENCH-SOVIET CONSULTATIONS ON AFRICA
1.  SUMMARY:  QUAI DIRECTOR FOR AFRICA (GEORGY), JUST
RETURNED FROM TWO DAYS OF CONSULTATIONS IN MOSCOW ON
AFRICA, BELIEVES SOVIETS MAINTAIN THEIR AMBITIONS FOR
EXPANSION IN THAT CONTINENT.  NEVERTHELESS, HE THINKS
SOVIETS, HAVING TRIED TO TAKE TWO LARGE STEPS FORWARD
IN AFRICA, ARE CURRENTLY TAKING ONE STEP BACK TO AVOID
CONFRONTATION WITH THE WEST.  SOVIETS STRESSED NEED TO
"DE-DRAMATIZE" AFRICAN SITUATION, AND APPEARED TO VALUE
DISCUSSION OF AFRICA WITH THE FRENCH.  GEORGY THINKS
THEY HAVE AN INTEREST IN STABILITY IN NORTH AFRICA AND
ARE DEEPLY TROUBLED BY QADHAFI.  END SUMMARY.
2.  QUAI DIRECTOR FOR AFRICA (GEORGY), JUST RETURNED
FROM TWO DAYS OF INTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS IN MOSCOW
ON AFRICA, AUGUST 9-10, GAVE CHARGE HIS IMPRESSIONS
AUGUST 16.  GEORGY SPENT SIX HOURS IN DISCUSSIONS WITH
VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ILLITCHEV AND NINE
HOURS WITH MFA'S THREE AFRICAN REGIONAL SECTION HEADS
AND THEIR STAFFS.  HE REPORTS THAT SOVIETS WERE
EXTREMELY CORDIAL AND APPEARED TO VALUE OPPORTUNITY
TO DISCUSS AFRICA WITH FRENCH.  THEY TOLD HIM THAT
THEY CANNOT DISCUSS AFRICA WITH OTHER POWERS; WITH THE
US DISCUSSIONS ALWAYS COME BACK TO STRATEGIC ISSUES
SUCH AS SALT; WITH THE UK THEY HAVE LITTLE DIALOGUE
AND THE FRG HAS NO REAL INTEREST OR EXPERTISE IN
AFRICAN AFFAIRS.  THE LEVEL OF SOVIET EXPERTISE WAS
HIGHER THAN EXPECTED, BUT THE SOVIETS TRIED TO AVOID
DISCUSSION OF SPECIFICS, AND KEPT TRYING TO COME BACK
TO PROPAGANDISTIC GENERALITIES.  GEORGY THOUGHT THEY
HAD LITTLE REAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITIES AND
FRAGILITY OF AFRICAN AFFIARS.
3.  GEORGY SAID HIS PRIMARY CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE
SOVIETS MAINTAIN THEIR AMBITIONS FOR EXPANSION IN
AFRICA.  EVERYTHING THEY SAY IS, OF COURSE, COUCHED
IN THEIR OWN TERMS, BUT THE MEANING IS CLEAR.  AT THE
SAME TIME, GEORGY THOUGHT THE SOVIETS WERE GOING
THROUGH A PERIOD OF "SOFT-PEDALING" ON AFRICA.  HE
WAS IMPRESSED BY THE REITERATION OF THE NEED TO
"DE-DRAMATIZE" THE SITUATION, A THEME WHICH RECURRED
CONSTANTLY THROUGHOUT HIS DISCUSSIONS.  GEORGY SUR-
MISED THAT THE SOVIETS WERE IN THE PRCESS OF TAKING
ONE STEP BACK, AFTER TRYING TO TAKE TWO BIG STEPS
FORWARD AND MEETING WESTERN RESISTENCE.  HE SAID THE
SOVIETS APPEARED TO SEE THE WESTERN ROLE IN AFRICA
IN TERMS OF ENCIRCLEMENT OF THE SOVIET UNION--OR AT
LEAST CLAIMED THEY DID--THUS THE US AIRLIFT OF TROOPS
TO SHABA WAS PART OF A BROAD NATO STRATEGY.  BUT THE
SOVIETS ALSO APPEARED TO WISH TO AVOID CONFRONTATION
IN AFRICA, AND WERE CURRENTLY IN A PHASE OF STEPPING
BACK AWAY FROM POSSIBLE CONFRONTATION.  (GEORGY WAS
CLEARLY PLEASED WITH THIS, WHICH HE SAW LARGELY AS
AN OUTCOME OF THE SHABA INTERVENTION.)
4.  GEORGY SAID THE SOVIETS WERE NOT SHARPLY CRITICAL
OF FRENCH POLICY, AND THAT HE RESPONDED FRANKLY WHEN-
EVER THEY WERE UNREASONABLE.  OF THE MANY SPECIFIC
COUNTRIES AND PROBLEMS WHICH WERE DISCUSSED, GEORGY
NOTED DISCUSSIONS OF NORTH AFRICA AS THE MOST INTEREST-
ING AND REVEALING.  HE SAID THAT THE EXPANSION OF
SOVIET TIES WITH MOROCCO--TO THE POINT WHERE THEY MAY
BE MORE IMPORTANT TO MOSCOW THAN SOVIET-ALGERIAN
RELATIONS--HAS PLACED THE SOVIETS IN A POSITION WHERE
THEY WISH TO AVOID HAVING TO CHOOSE SIDES BETWEEN
THE ALGERIANS AND THE MOROCCANS.  GEORGY BELIEVES THIS
GIVES THE SOVIETS AN IMPORTANT INTEREST IN STABILITY
IN NORTH AFRICA.  THUS THE SOVIETS WOULD PROBABLY
"DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY" TO MAKE POSSIBLE A SETTLEMENT
IN THE SAHARA--AND POSSIBLY IN CHAD AS WELL.  GEORGY
SAID THE SOVIETS WERE DEEPLY TROUBLED BY QADHAFI
BECAUSE OF HIS ADVENTURISM AND RELIGIOUS FANATICISM.
GEORGY NOTED THAT HE WAS IN MOSCOW WHEN THE SINO-
JAPANESE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY (PFT) WAS SIGNED,
AND THAT THE SOVIETS WERE PARTICULARLY ANGERED THAT
JALLOUD SHOULD CHOOSE THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT TO VISIT
PEKING.
5.  ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, GEORGY THOUGHT THE CONSULTA-
TIONS HAD BEEN WORTHWHILE, AND MAY HAVE GIVEN THE
SOVIETS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGITIMATE CON-
SIDERATIONS WHICH LIE BEHIND FRENCH AFRICAN POLICY.
